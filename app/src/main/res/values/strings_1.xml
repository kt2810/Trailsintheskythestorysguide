        She had a strange affection for Renne despite she was a member of the Society. She tried to bring Renne out of the Society but failed
            due to her naive nature of not knowing the dark side of the society and human nature. However, she acknowledged her
            weakness and did not give up on Renne. Estelle managed to shake Renne\'s mind greatly at Liber Ark but Renne
            still refused her.\n
        In the 3rd, Estelle had become more mature but her optimistic and naive nature were still remained when she were with her friend. \n
