        Let\'s explore what happens to Liberl of Zemuria continent in recent years.\n\n\n
        Summary:\n\n
        The story follows Estelle Bright and Joshua Bright, who just become junior Bracers from Liberl,
        are on their quest to become senior Bracers. The condition is to go to each major region in Liberl
        to earn recommendation letters from each Bracer Guild branch. In order to receive the letters, they must
        fulfill citizens\' requests to show their capabilities.\n\n
        However, their journeys are unlike any normal junior Bracers. The time they start their journeys was also
        when the coup planned by ex-Colonel Alan Richard was set in motion and close to final step.\n\n
        The Brights faced with many incidents that were rooted from the coup\'s plan in each region of Liberl,
        but they were unable to notice the plan as it was carefully hidden in multiple layers.\n\n
        During the kidnap incident of Prof. Albert Russell in Zeiss, together with C-rank bracer Agate Crosner,
        they were able to identify Colonel Richard was the source of all incidents the Brights dealt with.
        They also learnt the upcoming coup d\'teat would happen on the 60th Birthday Celebration of
        Queen Alicia von Auslese in Grancel.\n\n
        The Brights secretly informed the Guild to let every Bracer aware of the situation. However, under the
        law of Bracer Guild, we were unable to officially counter the coup from happening.\n\n
        The Liberl Intelligence Division was able to kidnap princess Klaudia von Aulese as she was returning to
        Grancel to attend her grandmother\'s birthday, and the Royal Guard was accused of planning the coup
        during this time. The Guild was able to obtain such information and quickly made an emergency
        rescue mission at Erbe Royal Villa, where the princess was held in custody.\n
        Due to the law of Bracer Guild, again, we were unable to act at first. But the Brights were able to
        contact Capt. Schwarz of the Royal Guard to request a secret joint rescue mission between the Bracer Guild
        and the Royal Guard. Thanks to the Royal Guard acted as the bait to lure most of Intelligence Division force
        to the front of Erbe Royal Villa, the Bracers were able to infiltrate the villa without being noticed.\n
        The mission was a success. We were able to locate the princess and took her under protection. After that,
        the Royal Guard gained a foothold at Erbe Royal Villa to prepare for the coup. Princess Klaudia also requested
        the Bracer Guild, as a citizen of Liberl, to stop the coup. Her action allowed us to legally counter
        the Intelligence Division when the coup happened.\n\n
        During the coup, the Royal Guards attacked the Intelligence Division directly while our bracers, Estelle Brights
        and Schera Harvey, and princess Klaudia infiltrated the Grancel castle by an airship.
        During this time, Queen Alicia was held under custody by 2nd Lt. Lorence of the Intelligence Division
        while Colonel Richard and his men were at the bottom of the castle to prepare for their final objective.\n
        The bracers and princess Klaudia were able to rescue Queen Alicia from 2nd Lt. Lorence.
        However, the reason was he gave up his mission due to his true identity and objective were different
        (More information in Trails in the Sky: SC).\n
        The Brights and several Bracers fought against Colonel Richard at the underground of Grancel castle. They were
        able to win against the Colonel, however, his plan was successful, which leaded to the attack from the Society
        one month later. The purpose of the coup will be explained in SC.\n\n
        S-rank bracer Cassius Bright returned to be Brigadier General of Liberl as he was during The Hundred Days War,
        which left S-rank bracer position empty for a long time. Liberl\'s peace returned for a very short period of time
        before the Society, Ouroboros, began their next step of Gospel Project.\n\n\n
